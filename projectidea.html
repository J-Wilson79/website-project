                                    <h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>Design and development of a mobile application that allows its user to track daily expenses, monitor overall net worth, and track savings goals. This will incorporate initial design and then creation of the interface, construction of the relevant coding, and finalising of the finished application. Finally leading into post development marketing and distribution of the final product. </p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Why?</h2>
									<p>As a person with little actual IT experience, I struggled for a while to come up with a project idea, that resonated. Our family unit is currently in the process of refinancing, changing our expense structure, whilst saving for multiple upcoming vacations. Currently we use two different banking apps to monitor savings totals, and we have multiple pages of notes on expenses, recurring payments, and savings goals. My wife in particular is not very financially minded, nor is she a great lover of maths. As a result, she much prefers me to explain and organise things simply, to ensure sheâ€™ll follow our plan. I believe a mobile app could assist with this outcome. </p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Details</h2>
									<p>This project is designed to fill the need created by the poor financial status of many Australian households. It will be designed with an easy to use interface, simple layout, yet easy to understand, whilst still incorporating all relevant data for complete modelling. Simple initial home screen, with relevant totals, current balances, set savings goals, and debt totals.</p>
									<p>Menu activation links to separate worksheet tables. Itemisation of each individual bank account, investment assets, and insurance values. Worksheets for itemisation and breakdown of invested assets, another generated for business interests, and also a worksheet for rental investments and their incomes. Which then continues onto a breakdown of the household assets. Liabilities will also need to be covered, with worksheets generated for short term totals such as credit card balances, and any known outstanding bills. Progressing into long term balances such as mortgages, personal loans, car loans or leases, outstanding student loans, or other accrued debts. Each individual worksheet can be totalled for its individual details, as well as being linked back into combined balances foreach section of assets and liabilities. These totals are then fed back into the calculations for combined totals on initial screen. </p>
									<p>Links to mobile banking applications can allow for the dynamic monitoring of cash flow, and other relevant transactions. This can integrate into finalising of outstanding bills, monitoring of direct debits, and any balance transfers. This attachment of the mobile banking application feature, allows the generation of push notification capabilities. This can be incorporated into any necessary field within the data, notifications of direct debits, movement of regular transfers, or bill or BPAY transactions.</p>
									<p>Push notifications can be expanded into features to set up individual customised notifications for various functions. This can be incorporated into the setting up of spending limits, or the over-use of funds on given accounts. Spending totals for individual items, via recognition of multiple transactions at the same coffee shop. Reward notifications can also be generated covering weekly expenditure below normal, finalisation of debts, or even the reaching of savings goals.  </p>
									<p>The application will be designed as a multi-platform. This will require the conversion of code to suit all smart devices on iOS, Android, and Blackberry. Tablet and notepad functionality will also be created allowing for full use and mobility. A base website application, for home computers, will also be created that allows compatibility with tablets and smart devices. </p>
									<p>Security features will be enabled, as a minimum password protection, with access to passcode feature. On relevant devices, fingerprint recognition or facial recognition, can be added as another level of security. Designation can be made of a base site for the application, with the ability of code generation, to approve the syncing and connection of extra devices. </p>

									<h2>Nuts and Bolts</h2>
									<p>Sencha, or Sencha touch appears to be a good starting platform for the construction of this app, and offers compatibility with Android, iOS, and Blackberry. </p>
									<p>WebSockets in conjunction with Pusher can be utilised to enable push notification attachment to various functions of the app. </p>
                                    <p>Notepad++ is my current platform of choice for any HTML5 coding, and the creator of this website. </p>
									<p>If cross platforming the app, some form of translation tool would become necessary, PhoneGap appears to be an easy to use option to achieve these results. </p>
									<p>Also, some form of worksheet creation, Microsoft Excell on the simple side. Otherwise templates for expense sheets, and savings totals could be utilised from free online sources. </p>
									
						            <hr class="major" />

									<h2>Skills</h2>
									<p>Knowledge of user interface design, whether by usage of tools providing templates, or creation from scratch, designing a user-friendly setup is a must. </p>
									<p>Proficiency in multiple programming languages such as Java and C#, and web development languages such as CSS, and HTML 5, would be a major bonus in the development stage. </p>
									<p>Ability to incorporate Backend capabilities, namely security for the app, any memory allocation necessary. As well as hardware interaction, and the appropriate database management. </p>
									<p>Finally, post app production, business and marketing knowledge will come into consideration, should the app be released for distribution amongst the general public. </p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Outcome</h2>
									<p>The development of the Money Matters mobile application, and its release for initial use by the general public. This allows for the more efficient monitoring of finances, better control of overall expenditure, and dynamic updating of total household net worth. </p>
									<p>Potential future links into Barefoot Investor strategies, and incorporation of Barefoot financial modelling ideals, to establish more stable economic environment. This could be achieved either through updates, or through secondary linked application. </p>
									<p>This leads into an overall reduction of household debt, arising from over expenditure, poor financial planning, and incorrect investment structures. Secondary application development can further this stability, with the potential of reducing reliance on the Retirement Pension scheme. This would result in the lowering of the impact this scheme has on the Federal Governments budget. </p>
