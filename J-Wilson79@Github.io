									    </header>
										<p>Born in Australia, and grew up on the south coast of NSW, currently living in Blayney in NSW central west. Family traces back a couple of generations to Scotland, and proudly wear my kilt on special occasions. As a result, only speak two languages, English and bad English. 

Went to school in Albion Park right through HSC, before starting an Electrical Apprenticeship. Finished Apprenticeship, and did about two years of study of Cert IV Electrical Engineering. 

Currently in transport industry, driving between Sydney and the central west, supplying retail with white goods. 

Computer gaming online as a hobby, still unable to get away from WoW (battletag Wyrm# 1393), though not quite the same amount of play time as when I started. </p>

											<p>Computers and gaming have always been an interest/hobby for me, from the beginnings playing on our families original Atari console, to our first home PC (Pentium 486dx2). I’ve always been asked to set stuff up, or show the rest of the family how to utilise their setups, and still get asked on visits back to family. My wife and I still game in our down time (we can’t seem to get away from WoW), and I’m currently working on both of us building new custom setups for the office/study. I found over this time, I’ve never really gotten into programming or coding much, which is one area I’d definitely like to change, and have no real IT experience other than what I’ve self-taught over the years. 

I’ve been considering further studies for a while now, and eventually got bullied by the wife to jump into some online studies part time to see if the workload fits. As a result, signed up with Open Universities, who deal with RMIT for the courses I’m in. 

As previously stated, definitely intending to develop some programming ability.</p>

											<h3>Network Operations Egineer</h3>
											<p>This first job, to break it down simply seems like maintenance crew for the servers. The job is for a company whose games I enjoy playing, and am passionate in my support, and seems like a realistic position I could maintain upon entry to the industry. The position calls for both knowledge of hardware and software, as well as problem solving ability, combined with a touch of security knowledge. Currently, I don’t tick any of the boxes, so it's going to be a lot of learning and training to get the skills required. Potentially completion of my degree, and maybe even an in-field internship along the way to pick up experience.</p

											<p>Ideal job is hard one for me, as I'm not sure exactly where I'm heading, or what exactly I want to achieve from this course yet. But setting that aside, looking through the job listings a few seem interesting. These are two potential careers I could see myself in, upon completion of studies, and a little bit of experience. </p>

											<h3>Deep Learning Machine Learning</h3>
											<p>This is a different job, though the field of AI does intrigue and excite me. Again, an area of zero prior qualifications, as they are looking for AI programming knowledge, as well as experience in network setup and deep learning. This would again require finalising of a degree as a minimum, also a switching to a different major (computer science), as well as field experience.</p

											<h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
											<p>Auditory.</p
											<p>If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.
                                            <p>As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.</p

											<h3>My thoughts on these reults</h3>
											<p>At no surprise to me, it shows I'm not the first person to jump into group activities, however I can work well in smaller groups of like-minded people. If I plan and organise well, I can utilise my strengths to work effectively at any problem I'm confronted with, especially if it truly interests or intrigues me. It's something I've had to work on as I've aged, and I believe I'm a lot better at being accepting of others, though I sometimes still get frustrated by those that don’t “keep up”. When forming a team, I think I'm best served by a smaller group, like-minded if possible, however I enjoy sharing my knowledge, and also love to continually learn new things. </p>
